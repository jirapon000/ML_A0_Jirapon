## Machine Learning Project Predicting AQI Level

### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting PM2.5 levels using machine learning and Geographic and Spatial Information (GSI) data. By integrating environmental, meteorological, and spatial factors, this model enhances air quality forecasting accuracy, aiding in urban planning, public health interventions, and policy decision-making.

Key features of this project include:
✅ Machine Learning-Based Prediction – Uses multiple ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, LSTM) to predict PM2.5 concentrations.
✅ Geographic and Spatial Data Integration – Incorporates elevation, land use, traffic density, and satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data.
✅ Real-Time Data Processing – Supports live air quality monitoring with time-series analysis.
✅ Bangkok-Specific AQI Forecasting – Tailored to Bangkok’s pollution dynamics, filling research gaps in Southeast Asia.

This repository contains the dataset, preprocessing scripts, model training notebooks, and visualization tools necessary for reproducible research and deployment.
